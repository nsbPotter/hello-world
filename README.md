# hello-world
This is my first repository. It is just for learning and testing purpose.

My name is Nicolas Breinl and I am currently studying Ingenieurinformatik B.Sc. at the University of Augsburg. I am a working student at KUKA Deutschland GmBH in the Quality Assurance System Architecture Team. My interest for software development is growing every day. I created this Github-account to join the community and to start creating (and sharing) my own projects. At the moment I am looking for a good idea to start my first project. I am looking for something that is fairly easy to create, but is also expandable. (24/09/18)

Ideas so far: 
  TaskManager for my most used applications with a nice UI. (JavaFX)
